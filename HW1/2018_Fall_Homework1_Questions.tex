\paragraph{Q1:} We wish to set all pixels that have a brightness of 10 or less to 0, to remove sensor noise. However, our code is slow when run on a database with 1000 grayscale images.

\emph{Image:} \href{grizzlypeakg.png}{grizzlypeakg.png}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
A = imread('grizzlypeakg.png');
[m1,n1] = size( A );
for i=1:m1
    for j=1:n1
        if A(i,j) <= 10
            A(i,j) = 0;
        end
    end
end
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Q1.1:} How could we speed it up?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A1.1:} Your answer here.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
A = imread('grizzlypeakg.png');
B = A <= 10;
A(B) = 0;
\end{lstlisting}

Using Logical Indexing


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Q1.2:} What factor speedup would we receive over 1000 images? Please measure it.

Ignore file loading; assume all images are equal resolution; don't assume that the time taken for one image $\times1000$ will equal $1000$ image computations, as single short tasks on multitasking computers often take variable time.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A1.2:} Your answer here.

In MATLAB, time performance is increased when using logical indexing instead of for loops. Difference in performance is very small when processing 1 image, but it becomes very large when processing over 1000 images. 

Because of ignoring image loading time, 'imread' time performance is excluded from evaluating performance.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
%using for loops
A = imread('grizzlypeakg.png');
tic;
[m1,n1] = size( A );
for k = 1:1000
    for i=1:m1
        for j=1:n1
            if A(i,j) <= 10
                A(i,j) = 0;`
            end
        end
    end
end
toc;
\end{lstlisting}
result: Elapsed time is 11.571143 seconds.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
%using logical indexing
A = imread('grizzlypeakg.png');
tic;
for i=1:1000
    B = A <= 10;
    A(B) = 0;
end
toc;
\end{lstlisting}
result: Elapsed time is 6.514478 seconds.

The speed is about two times faster when using logical indexing instead of for loops.

\paragraph{Q1.3:} How might a speeded-up version change for color images? Please measure it.

\emph{Image:} \href{grizzlypeak.jpg}{grizzlypeak.jpg}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A1.3:} Your answer here.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
%using for loops
A = imread('grizzlypeak.jpg');
tic;
[m1,n1,o] = size( A );
for l = 1:1000
    for i=1:m1
        for j=1:n1
            for k =1:o
                if A(i,j,k) <= 10
                    A(i,j,k) = 0;
                end
            end
        end
    end
end
toc;
\end{lstlisting}
result: Elapsed time is 62.397869 seconds.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
%using logical indexing
A = imread('grizzlypeak.jpg');
tic;
for i=1:1000
    B = A <= 10;
    A(B) = 0;
end
toc;
\end{lstlisting}
result: Elapsed time is 21.000940 seconds.

The speed is about three times faster when using logical indexing instead of for loops. 

When processing color images, the rate of increase in time performance is higher than when processing grayscale images

\paragraph{Q2:} We wish to reduce the brightness of an image but, when trying to visualize the result, all we sees is white with some weird ``corruption'' of color patches.

\emph{Image:} \href{gigi.jpg}{gigi.jpg}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
I = double( imread('gigi.jpg') );
I = I - 20;
imshow( I );
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Q2.1:} What is incorrect with this approach? How can it be fixed while maintaining the same amount of brightness reduction?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A2.1:} Your answer here.

When using 'imshow', if the image is in floating-point format, MATLAB assumes that the pixel values are in between 0 and 1. If pixel value is over than 1, it is considered to be 1. So we have to normalize image from 0 to 1 using 'im2double' to see the correct image.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
I = imread('gigi.jpg');
I = I - 20;
I = im2double( I );
imshow( I );
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Q2.2:} Where did the original corruption come from? Which specific values in the original image did it represent?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A2.2:} Your answer here.

There are pixels with all three RGB values equal to or greater than 21. Then when 'I = I - 20' is executed, the RGB values of that pixels equal to or greater than 1. So that pixels are considered to be (R, G, B) = (1, 1, 1) (White) when using 'imshow'.

At this time, the pixels having any one of the RGB values of 20 or less are become pixels with any one of the RGB values of 0 or less when 'I = I - 20' is executed. So that pixels are considered to be RGB values will contain at least one zero when using 'imshow'. These pixels are seen as a different color than white so they become corruption.
